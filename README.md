# teranode-base

This repo contains Dockerfiles for both 'build' as well as 'run' container images used as a base for the Teranode project.

These container images exist to install build and runtime dependencies for the application, and are sourced at the top of the main Teranode Dockerfile at https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/teranode/blob/main/Dockerfile
