# teranode-base

This repo contains Dockerfiles for both a 'build' as well as 'run' container images used as a base for the Teranode project.

These exist to install build and runtime dependencies for the application, and are sourced at the top of the main Teranode Dockerfile at https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/teranode/blob/main/Dockerfile
